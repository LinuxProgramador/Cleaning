Tool that allows you to delete multimedia files without the possibility of recovering the content of the file. 

Functionality with the -s option: Reads the multimedia file in binary,
then creates a secure key with the Fernet function and encrypts the multimedia file in binary in RAM with AES-128 .
It then overwrites the file with the already encrypted file and deletes it, ensuring that even if it is recovered, it is not readable.


Functionality with the -l option: what it does is create a random salt in binary, then the file is overwritten with that salt until it reaches 2G, then it is trimmed and deleted, only used in cases of very large files that cannot be deleted from a phone due to the lag generated by the -s option


The -l option does not guarantee a complete overwrite because it overwrites the file with a default size and not with the file size itself, as is the case with -s
